# Using Kotlin Multiplatform XCFramework/Framework in Swift

[WIP]

The Kotlin Multiplatform library that is being used in this project is [here](https://github.com/arskov/kmp-native-pg).

The XCode project contains a copy of the XCFramework created by KMP project. If you update the Kotlin code, you need to rebuild the KMP project, and then overwrite all XCFramework files in the `KmpSample.xcframework`.
